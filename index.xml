For me, how you approach them is 80% of the work.</description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Not was always the case that I knew how to deal with expectations. Not a long ago, I found myself not getting the job done, or so I thought. The tasks and the goals I had, were never completed for me, and this situation made me anxious and kept me stuck in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deadlock">deadlock</a>, not making steps because I wasn&rsquo;t happy with my situation.</p>
<p>I tried as hard as I could, but I couldn&rsquo;t get away with the resentment feelings, and working remotely didn&rsquo;t help. But people were happy with my work, in fact, they always had good words about me, &ldquo;how could that be?&rdquo; I didn&rsquo;t feel like I was giving my 100%, but for people it was more than enough.</p>
<p>The only thing that happened was that I was trapped in my own expectations, always trying to do the &ldquo;right thing&rdquo; no matter what, was killing me. I had impostor syndrome on my work and on my personal life, I wasn&rsquo;t always enough and the self-judgment thoughts were going to the roof.</p>
<p>Then I thought, &ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t people have big goals? There has to be more, we are not that different&rdquo;, and I was right. A better approach was the puzzle piece that was missing. It wasn&rsquo;t realistic for me to achieve all my aspirations fast and at the same time, so at the start of this year, I set myself some goals to achieve by the end of the year, and I&rsquo;ve already completed some of them.</p>
<p>For me, setting myself achievable goals with a fixed deadline is the best way of actually doing something to make them happen. Furthermore, I&rsquo;m learning to deal with the fact that results not always depend on my actions, and that they don&rsquo;t define me as a person. In fact reading, one of these goals, have helped me a lot to deal with these emotions.</p>
<p>I realized that whenever I feel fear or anxiety about something, maybe that&rsquo;s the right path.
Or maybe not the right path, but at least I&rsquo;m taking one, in this case the blog, let&rsquo;s see if it goes somewhere.</p>
