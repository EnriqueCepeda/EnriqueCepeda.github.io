How would I be fulfilled if I don't fight for what I care for? 

Some months ago I wrote a post _("[About goals and expectations](#about-goals-and-expectations)")_ , in which I stated that I was stressed out by the feeling of not having achieved my goals. Maybe that's not it. Maybe it's that I'm not doing enough in the present.

Some time ago I decided not to focus my energy in the past nor the future. But, if I don't focus in the present either, how am I going to achieve big things? How am I going to live the life that I want? I know things don't come free of charge, thinking otherwise would be delusional. 

If I don't pay attention, no one is going to do it. It's extremely easy to fall into a self-indulgent trap, no self-criticism, there's always an excuse. 

&nbsp;

Not that long ago I was talking with a friend about this, and he asked me:

\- _Why do these things matter so much to you? Why the posts? This is repeatitive theme for you_

I didn't have the answer at the moment, but now I think I maybe have it:

Aspirations and goals matter so much to me because I don't do what I know I ought to, not because of my status quo respecting my goals. I know I'm not near the best version of myself, and I know I'm not anywhere near what I'm capable of.

&nbsp;

For me, the key is going to be "do what you ought to do". Seek discomfort. In that way, maybe I don't fulfill my goals, but at least I know I've tried. At least I've tried with all the consequences.
