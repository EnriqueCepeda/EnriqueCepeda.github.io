One year after finishing college, after starting on my "life journey" on a 9 to 5 job, I feel is time to reflect on who I want to be.

I have no doubt that all humans try to find ways of spending our time on earth the best way possible. However, there is a lot of distractions that cloud our judgment and tear us apart from our dreams and aspirations. I'm no exception.  

Each time I notice I'm not doing what I should, I feel a sense of dreadfulness inside me. A thought that tells me this one is the last, next time it will be better, but it won't.

Maybe is time to change now, maybe is time to reflect and talk with myself about the things I want in life, and what are my values. About I do, why should I do it or why not.
Why is the case that sometimes I feel stuck in a rut and how I get out of that.

For me, inspiration is a big motivator. I want to do the things that excites me, I want to cook, I want to learn new things, I want to enjoy life with my loved ones, I want to visit beautiful places, I want to live.

This is a message to me and to you. Be what excites you, fight and work for these things and you'll never feel you have to be distracted.
