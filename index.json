[{"content":"Not was always the case that I knew how to deal with expectations. Not a long ago, I found myself not getting the job done, or so I thought. The tasks and the goals I had, were never completed for me, and this situation made me anxious and kept me stuck in a deadlock, not making steps because I wasn\u0026rsquo;t happy with my situation.\nI tried as hard as I could, but I couldn\u0026rsquo;t get away with the resentment feelings, and working remotely didn\u0026rsquo;t help. But people were happy with my work, in fact, they always had good words about me, \u0026ldquo;how could that be?\u0026rdquo; I didn\u0026rsquo;t feel like I was giving my 100%, but for people it was more than enough.\nThe only thing that happened was that I was trapped in my own expectations, always trying to do the \u0026ldquo;right thing\u0026rdquo; no matter what, was killing me. I had impostor syndrome on my work and on my personal life, I wasn\u0026rsquo;t always enough and the self-judgment thoughts were going to the roof.\nThen I thought, \u0026ldquo;Doesn\u0026rsquo;t people have big goals? There has to be more, we are not that different\u0026rdquo;, and I was right. A better approach was the puzzle piece that was missing. It wasn\u0026rsquo;t realistic for me to achieve all my aspirations fast and at the same time, so at the start of this year, I set myself some goals to achieve by the end of the year, and I\u0026rsquo;ve already completed some of them.\nFor me, setting myself achievable goals with a fixed deadline is the best way of actually doing something to make them happen. Furthermore, I\u0026rsquo;m learning to deal with the fact that results not always depend on my actions, and that they don\u0026rsquo;t define me as a person. In fact reading, one of these goals, have helped me a lot to deal with these emotions.\nI realized that whenever I feel fear or anxiety about something, maybe that\u0026rsquo;s the right path. Or maybe not the right path, but at least I\u0026rsquo;m taking one, in this case the blog, let\u0026rsquo;s see if it goes somewhere.\nThe impediment to action advances action. What stands in the way becomes the way.\n","permalink":"https://EnriqueCepeda.github.io/about-goals-and-expectations/","summary":"Not was always the case that I knew how to deal with expectations.

However, there is a lot of distractions that cloud our judgment and tear us apart from our dreams and aspirations. I\u0026rsquo;m no exception.\nEach time I notice I\u0026rsquo;m not doing what I should, I feel a sense of dreadfulness inside me. A thought that tells me this one is the last, next time it will be better, but it won\u0026rsquo;t.\nMaybe is time to change now, maybe is time to reflect and talk with myself about the things I want in life, and what are my values. About I do, why should I do it or why not. Why is the case that sometimes I feel stuck in a rut and how I get out of that.\nFor me, inspiration is a big motivator. I want to do the things that excites me, I want to cook, I want to learn new things, I want to enjoy life with my loved ones, I want to visit beautiful places, I want to live.\nThis is a message to me and to you.
